        <h1>Solar Power 2021</h1>
        <p>
          Solar Power is the third studio album by New Zealand singer-songwriter
          Lorde, released in 2021. There are three singles in the album: “Solar
          Power,” “Stoned at the Nail Salon,” and “Mood Ring.” On May 25, 2021,
          Primavera Sound on Twitter announced that Lorde would be performing in
          the Primavera Sound Festival in 2022. <br />
        </p>

        <p>
          This led to many speculations and rumors on the app, especially
          considering the fact that their official website had stated: “Lorde…
          will emerge from her retirement with her third album after her
          unforgettable visit in 2018.” Later on June 2, 2021, an insider by the
          name of RideOrDie had confirmed that Lorde would be releasing “Solar
          Power” as her lead single and “Mood Ring” as her promotional single.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of the text he wrote: “She really hates the winter I
          guess.” June 7 finally brought something from Lorde. Jack Antonoff,
          Lorde's producer, had posted a picture of the cover of “Solar Power”
          on his Instagram and Lorde's website was updated to say “Coming in
          2021” and “Patience is a Virtue”. After the song being leaked and
          released early on June 10, Lorde sent an email to her fans announcing
          that not only would her lead single be titled “Solar Power”, so would
          her third album. She also mentioned how her song was released on the
          only solar eclipse of the year, and to look at the natural calendar
          for clues on when her album would come out.
        </p>

        <p><b>Critical Reception</b></p>

        <p>
          In Pitchfork's review, critic Anna Gaca claims that Lorde's new album
          “tries to be bigger and smaller at the same time, spanning scenes of
          domestic bliss and apocalyptic flight without the conceptual
          architecture to unite them. “It is the first Lorde album that doesnt
          try to tug on your sleeve, or stare directly into your eyes. It feels
          like doing less.” Stereogum's James Rettig added: “Solar Power isn't
          necessarily a bad hang if you approach it as background music… But for
          an artist that usually sounds so immediate and vital, it's hard not to
          feel like this is a letdown” The AV Club goes as far as saying that
          the album's producer Jack Antonoff, who's helped produce Taylor
          Swift's 1989 and Folklore, Lana Del Rey's Norman Fucking Rockwell! and
          Lorde's Melodrama, “should be dethroned as the pop producer of
          choice.”
