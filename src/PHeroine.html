        <h1>Pure Heroine 2013</h1>
        <p>
          Pure Heroine is the debut studio album by New Zealand singer Lorde. It
          was released through Universal Music Group, Lava, and Republic on
          September 27, 2013. The album is the product of a collaboration
          between Lorde and producer Joel Little. After releasing her first EP
          The Love Club EP and its lead single “Royals” in 2013, the pair
          continued writing and producing material. Pure Heroine is a dream pop,
          electronica and electropop album built around minimal production, deep
          bass, and programmed beats. Lyrically, the album discusses youth and
          critiques of mainstream culture. The album has sold more than three
          million copies worldwide since its release. Lorde began writing songs
          on guitar at the age of “13 or 14”. She was eventually paired with New
          Zealand compatriot writer and producer Joel Little and this working
          relationship clicked almost immediately. Lorde's debut extended play,
          2013's The Love Club EP, received acclaim from music critics who
          compared the EP to the work of Sky Ferreira, Florence + the Machine,
          Lana Del Rey, and Grimes, and reached number one in New Zealand,
          number two in Australia where it was certified five times platinum for
          shipments of 350,000 copies, and twenty-three on the US Billboard 200.

          <b> Critical Reception</b> <br />

          Pure Heroine received acclaim from music critics, who praised its
          lyrical content and minimalistic production. At review aggregate site
          Metacritic, it has an average score of 79 out of 100, based on 28
          reviews, indicating “generally favorable” reviews. Jason Lipshutz of
          Billboard gave the album a score of 94, describing the album as
          “immaculate” and stating that Lorde was “the most vocally striking and
          lyrically thought-provoking” artist to break through in recent times.
          He also compared Joel Little's bass, loops, and rhythms, on the album,
          to the dark electronica of English bands Massive Attack and The xx.
          Furthermore, Lipshutz called the album “honest and addictive”; stating
          that “the age of Lorde” had begun. Tom Cardy of The Dominion Post gave
          the album 4 out of 5 stars, stating that although the album was not
          “ground-breaking” and didn't offer any “surprises”, it was a “pure
          gold” follow-up to her extended play The Love Club and was a “strong”
          debut album. David Farrier of 3 News gave a very favorable review of
          the album, stating that it lives “up to the hype” that it's lead
          single “Royals” created and exceeded expectations. Farrier called
          Lorde's writing “so good” and praised her maturity; describing the
          album as “sonically delightful”, “utterly unique”, and timeless. Joe
          Cristo of Move gave the album 5 out of 5 stars; calling it
          “breathtaking” and “flawless”. Cristo said the album completely lacked
          filler tracks and rivaled “every other record that has come out within
          the last year, and possibly in the last ten [years].”
