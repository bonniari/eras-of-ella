        <h1>Melodrama 2017</h1>
        <p>
          Melodrama is the sophomore studio album by Lorde released on June
          16th, 2017. “Green Light”, “Perfect Places”, “Sober” and
          “Liability”were announced to be singles and promotional singles from
          the album, respectively. Writing for the album began as early as
          December 2013 and continued through “false starts, fruitless detours
          and stretches of inactivity” as Lorde stepped back from the public
          spotlight, taking shape after her breakup from her longtime boyfriend
          in 2015. Melodrama is described as a loose concept album that explores
          the theme of solitude, in the framework of a single house party with
          the events and moods that entail it. The album was met with universal
          acclaim, earning the #1 spot in the USA, Canada, New Zealand, and
          Australia, and earning a 91 on Metacritic. Lorde revealed on an
          interview with New York Times that each song is color coded. She
          revealed, “A song about partying would get a certain color, but it
          might be a sad song, and that got its own color, too.”

          <b>Critical Reception</b> <br />
          Stacey Anderson of Pitchfork called it a “masterful study of being a
          young woman, a sleek and humid pop record full of grief and hedonism,
          crafted with the utmost care and wisdom”, giving it an 8.8. Meanwhile
          for Rolling Stone, Will Hermes called it a “tour de force” saying
          “It's emblematic of a modern pop record that prizes old-school
          intimacy, and lingers well after the house lights have gone up.” Slant
          Magazine's Sal Cinquemani described “Hard Feelings” as an
          “industrial-infused” song, and “Loveless” as “the most shamelessly
          poppy track that Lorde has recorded to date, peppered with prickly bon
          mots”. It did well overall, with a score of 92/100 on Metacritic,
          along with a 4/5 on Rolling Stone and 5/5 on NME. <br />

          <br />
          Nolan Feeney of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a rating of 'A',
          writing that “Lorde makes partying sound holy” and that “the
          shape-shifting compositions give Melodrama a richer, more dynamic
          palette than the muted, minimalist beats of Pure Heroine”. Feeney also
          notes, “The tracks are in constant dialogue with themselves: Motifs of
          riding in cars and the “ribbons” that bind her to a lover repeat
          throughout the album, adding layers to the story.”
